<p>tags: <a href="http://ninly.github.io/tag/crypto/">crypto</a></p></footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I started up this blog as a place to muse on current tech projects and
share what I'm doing and learning. Then I went and got re-mired in my
Matasano code, which I can't share.</p>
<p>Last spring, on a tip from <a class="reference external" href="http://illruminations.com/">Steve</a>, I spent a bunch of time working on the then-brand-new
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/">Matasano Crypto Challenges</a>, which you should go read about if you're
not already familiar.</p>
<p>It was perfect for me in a lot of ways. In addition to my longstanding
interest in things cryptological, it was a perfect venue to try my hand
at more &quot;practical&quot; code, as I described in a <a class="reference external" href="http://ninly.github.io/posts/2014/01/pip-and-virtualenv-sans-magic/">previous post</a>. The
exercises are (more or less) graded, and in many cases tell you roughly
how you're going to approach the goal. I plugged at the first set of
exercises for a few days, and felt like I'd wrapped my head around
something new. I finished the first set and received the second, and
things got even more interesting.</p>
<p>Without revealing any content, I'll say that exercise 12 was
particularly fun, engaging, and rewarding to accomplish. I felt quite a
bit of momentum, and ready to tackle whatever came at me.</p>
<p>Then, I hit exercise 13. I got stuck.</p>
<p>I think the exercise assumed a certain level of practical familiarity
with web-transaction infrastructure. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[*]</a> User authentication, cookies,
that sort of thing. I know more or less how that stuff works, but have
little hands-on experience actually implementing them for a production
website. Building on what I'd learned from the exercises thus far, I
quickly sort of painted myself into a corner, feeling like every avenue
I pursued wound up a dead end.</p>
<p>Having a brand-new baby in the house also didn't help. Time devoted to
the project evaporated for a time.</p>
<p>There was a HDD failure on my dev/hacking machine, too, but that's
another post.</p>
<p>This week, after several months away from the code, I revisited the
Matasano Crypto Challenges. I worked through my existing code, reminding
myself what I'd done and how. I reimplemented a few functions, just to
see if different ways to do things seemed cleaner or appealed more.
Some did. And, as a lot of coders say, reading your own code months or
years later can be painful, but also eye-opening.</p>
<p>Then I approached that sticky wicket, exercise 13, with a fresh mind. I
didn't even look at the code I'd written for it; I just reread the
assignment, and started coding.</p>
<p>I got my test code to pass yesterday. Turns out, it wasn't that bad.  My
solution isn't perfect: I'm not entirely happy with some of the
assumptions it makes (again, I'm trying not to reveal anything about the
exercise content here), but it works, and at least I have something to
improve on now.</p>
<p>And, best of all, now I get to think about exercise 14.</p>
