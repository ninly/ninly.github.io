and generally having a pretty good time with my python development
experience. However, I kept running into interesting code examples and
projects that required matplotlib and the numpy/scipy stack. Since I've
also been trying to get familiar with mathematical modeling, analysis
and visualization techniques, these are indispensable dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could (and had) play with them &amp;quot;raw&amp;quot;, but ran into problems when I
tried to enjoy the control and isolation afforded by virtualenv. Last
week, though, in one of my periodic attempts to comb through dependency
installations, I stumbled on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/fyears/7601881"&gt;this gist&lt;/a&gt;, and it cleared up all my
problems. I haven't delved into whatever reasons may have existed for my
previous difficulties, but if you're having trouble, maybe it will help
you. All I did was to set up a new virtual env and pip-install my way
through the list. It... just worked, for the most part (thanks,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.fyears.org/"&gt;fyears&lt;/a&gt;!), although I did have to update some fortran-compiler stuff
that numpy needed.&lt;/p&gt;
