Like magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not go into much detail here about the setup of this site or how
I got here, but a few resources did help me quite a bit along the way.
Among them (and I've probably missed a one or two):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican itself&lt;/a&gt;, of course&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://duncanlock.net/blog/2013/05/17/how-i-built-this-website-using-pelican-part-1-setup/"&gt;Duncan Lock&lt;/a&gt;, whose post got me down the road a good long way -- but
who still owes us a Part 2!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://terriyu.info/blog/posts/2013/07/pelican-setup/"&gt;Terri Yu&lt;/a&gt;, whose post also helped me muck through the pelican setup&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gist.github.com/josefjezek/6053301"&gt;How to use Pelican on GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;, by Josef Jezek, with additional
details about ghp-import in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/blob/master/docs/tips.rst"&gt;these tips&lt;/a&gt; from the Pelican docs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kecebongsoft.com/"&gt;Dedi Purwanto&lt;/a&gt;, mostly for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/cebong"&gt;theme&lt;/a&gt;, but nice blog, too :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In practice, the real work had more to do with deciding how to host
and organize my content, and recommendations are thin for that sort
of thing. That seems appropriate to a static-site generator such as
pelican. The whole point: you do it however you want. It's not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;
hard, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, assuming this project sticks around awhile, it will probably
be a casual work in progress for some time. Since what I'm after is
a simple dumping ground for ideas, development progress, and makery
learnings, I hope to remain focused more on content and ideas, rather
than packaging and presentation (except insofar as these constitute
makery learnings). But do contact me if you have any recommendations
or notice something I've obviously overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few honorable mentions and bookmarks: blog posts and articles about
pelican, static-site generators, and devblogging in general that I
didn't use explicitly when initially setting up this site, but which
I've come across and expect to come back to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helder Correira's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://heldercorreia.com/blog/from-wordpress-to-pelican"&gt;From Wordpress to Pelican&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Geoff Gimse's intriguingly titled &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.textandhubris.com"&gt;Text and Hubris&lt;/a&gt; (several posts,
but the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.textandhubris.com/tag/pelican"&gt;pelican-tagged articles&lt;/a&gt; are a place to start)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</summary><category term="blog"></category></entry><entry><title>call("o muse");</title><link href="http://ninly.github.io/posts/2014/01/call-o-muse/" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-01-01T10:20:00-06:00</updated><author><name>ninly</name></author><id>tag:ninly.github.io,2014-01-01:posts/2014/01/call-o-muse/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I didn't actually write this post on New Year's Day, nor does this blog have much to do with the new year, but it's a convenient and timely starting point. So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hello world!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I'm like a lot of people who use static-blog engines (pelican, jekyll, etc.), in that I'm no longer very thrilled with available hosted services. Intermittently, I've wanted a place to record thoughts and progress specifically related to my efforts to learn technological skills, particularly coding and electronics. To that end, I'm not really looking for the kind of &amp;quot;social&amp;quot; experience offered by a Blogger, Tumblr, or Twitter -- but on the other hand, I'd like something more dynamic, versioned, and publicly accessible than personal pen-and-paper diary or development notebook. I'd like an easy way both to look back over what I've done and how far I have (or haven't) come with a project, as well as an easy resource to share with people who may be interested in that progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, don't look here for subtle, crafted prose and public relations. Just notes, some thoughts, nods to the helpful posts and pages of other developers, and probably a few bookmark-like links to help me remember helpful resources. However, you are welcome here; If any of this content is helpful to you, then all the more benefit!&lt;/p&gt;
